# 🃏 COMBO DOUZE
🎮 A Luck-Based Game in Python

# 🌟 About the Game
COMBO DOUZE is a completely luck-based game played between 3 players, using number cards ranging from 1 to 9. The goal? Be the first to get a total card value of 12 and call out “DOUZE!” (French for 12). Developed in Python, this game is simple yet thrilling, designed to test your patience and luck.
